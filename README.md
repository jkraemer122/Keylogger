# Keylogger
A simple keylogger in Python

## Info
This keylogger is programmed in Python and uses the Pynput module. It takes each keystroke that is pressed after it starts running and puts it into a list. If the key that is pressed is a spacebar, it will start a new line in the txt file. 
Included is the source code and "log.txt". If you do not want to use the filename "log.txt", create a new txt file in the save location of the source code and change line 24 to match the name of the new txt file.
